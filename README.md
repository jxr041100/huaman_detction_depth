# huaman_detction_depth

      the code is used to detect the clearence for robot using the depth image. 
# 1 Compile the code

mkdir build

cd build

cmake ..

make


# 2 Run the code

./DepthHuman filename.txt

# 3 Next step
    (1) human detection based on machine learning or deep learning approach can be applied;
    (2) depth quality from depth sensor is very important;
    (3) deep learning approaches for obstacle can be explored.
